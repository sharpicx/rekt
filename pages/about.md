hello, i'm <span class="blue" style="padding-bottom: 5px;">sharpicx</span>.

<p style="padding-bottom: 5px">
i'm living in <span class="blue">Indonesia</span> and i'd prefer to get myself taking a free-time as learning and practicing to sharpen my cybersecurity skills especially for exploit development & reversing (kinda bad).
i'm also having chill with cybersecurity fields such as threat intelligence gathering & web app security. 
</p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 5px"> 
this site built by myself which means that i have set this up on my own to write all of my interests based on computer stuff and maybe some of random fields i been in. as i said, i can write anything as i wanted and if u like being reader in this blog feel free to discuss those things i talked about with me. dont feel freak if i posted something different.
</p>

i'm a big fan of these guys who have inspired me as a hacker and i would like to say a thank to them!
